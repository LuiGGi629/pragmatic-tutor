### 3 different approaches that Python can take to this;
- threads
- processes
- asyncIO

## Knowing when to choose one over another is super important

```{python}
Image(filename='synchronous-execution.png')
```

```{python}
Image(filename='async-execution.png')
```

# Simple Generator
    - Generators are "restartable" functions --> they can run to a point and then stop, and then resume.

```{python}
Image(filename='simple-generator.png')
```

### Color in threading and concurrency is super helpful to understand what part is happening where and in what order it's all hapening.

```{python}
Image(filename='colorama.png')
```

## This is the execution side of things:

```{python}
Image(filename='execution.png')
```

## The two steps;
    - Begin by making method async
    - Await all async methods you call

```{python}
Image(filename='async-await-keywords.png')
```

## aiohttp

```{python}
Image(filename='aiohttp-syntax.png')
```

## Here the goal is to start all of the tasks, and then we are going to either just get their value right back or wait.
## Now block or wait for that response to come in, and get the next task. Maybe it's already done?
## Instead of trying to do one at the time, we are going to start them all, and then processes them all.

```{python}

```{python}
